# new-project-starter-boilerplate
My new project starter kit - Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, and HTML boilerplate


## How to use
- Click the "Use this template button above
- Or git clone this repo


## How to build your CSS file:
- Run 'npm run build' - This will generate a main.css file in the build folder.
- Cool part about Tailwind css is you won't need a server (for the most part) after the css is built (If you're using the inline classes in your html).
